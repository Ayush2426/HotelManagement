Project â€“ Hotel Management System

Project Description:
It is a desktop-based Hotel Management System developed using Core Java, leveraging Swing and AWT libraries for creating a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). The system streamlines hotel operations such as room booking, check-in/check-out management, customer records, billing, and staff administration. Data storage and retrieval are managed through MySQL Workbench, ensuring secure and efficient database connectivity. The application is built and executed within the IntelliJ IDEA environment, utilizing Java's JDBC API for smooth integration with the MySQL database. HotelEase aims to simplify administrative tasks, enhance guest service efficiency, and maintain accurate records, making it ideal for small to mid-sized hotels.
